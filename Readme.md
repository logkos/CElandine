CElandine Operating System
==

CElandine is open source reimplementation of now-discontinued Windows Compact Embedded (CE) operating system from Microsoft in Rust.
It (will) contain a kernel, bootloader, modules, and a toolchain.

This is a soleman project, so it will be slow and nothing guaranteed
